      <dl>
        <dt>Photographic Camera</dt>
        <dd>1816: The first working iteration of an image capturing device was invented by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. The properly developed photo, of a house, didn’t come until 10 years later, but remains intact to this day.</dd>

        <dd>1824:First communicative use of accessibility and geometry created by Louis Braille. These formations were known as matrices.</dd>
        <dt>Development of Morse Code</dt>
        <dd>1830:First communication method, created by Samuel Morse,utilizes signal patterns to encode text as sequences of different signal durations using what is known as dots and dashes. </dd>
        <dt>MetaData Emergence</dt>
        <dd>1967: Two MIT students, Stuart McIntosh and David Griffel, mention the need for advancement of Meta-Data Language to assist researchers in finding relevant information and resources.</dd>
        <dt>QR Software Introduced </dt>
        <dd>1994: The first QR was created by DENSO WAVE, after supermarkets reached out because they wanted to find a way to make the bar code more versatile, and hold more information. </dd>
